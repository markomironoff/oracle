# DOC>   The following PL/SQL block invokes UTL_RECOMP to recompile invalid
# DOC>   objects in the database. Recompilation time is proportional to the
# DOC>   number of invalid objects in the database, so this command may take
# DOC>   a long time to execute on a database with a large number of invalid
# DOC>   objects.
# DOC>
# DOC>   Use the following queries to track recompilation progress:
# DOC>
# DOC>   1. Query returning the number of invalid objects remaining. This
# DOC>      number should decrease with time.
# DOC>         SELECT COUNT(*) FROM obj$ WHERE status IN (4, 5, 6);
# DOC>
# DOC>   2. Query returning the number of objects compiled so far. This number
# DOC>      should increase with time.
# DOC>         SELECT COUNT(*) FROM UTL_RECOMP_COMPILED;
# DOC>
# DOC>   This script automatically chooses serial or parallel recompilation
# DOC>   based on the number of CPUs available (parameter cpu_count) multiplied
# DOC>   by the number of threads per CPU (parameter parallel_threads_per_cpu).
# DOC>   On RAC, this number is added across all RAC nodes.
# DOC>
# DOC>   UTL_RECOMP uses DBMS_SCHEDULER to create jobs for parallel
# DOC>   recompilation. Jobs are created without instance affinity so that they
# DOC>   can migrate across RAC nodes. Use the following queries to verify
# DOC>   whether UTL_RECOMP jobs are being created and run correctly:
# DOC>
# DOC>   1. Query showing jobs created by UTL_RECOMP
# DOC>         SELECT job_name FROM dba_scheduler_jobs
# DOC>            WHERE job_name like 'UTL_RECOMP_SLAVE_%';
# DOC>
# DOC>   2. Query showing UTL_RECOMP jobs that are running
# DOC>         SELECT job_name FROM dba_scheduler_running_jobs
# DOC>            WHERE job_name like 'UTL_RECOMP_SLAVE_%';
